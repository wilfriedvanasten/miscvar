miscvar
=======

Various and miscelaneous little pieces of code and config files I use on my linux systems.

These things are created for personal use and are designed with my standard configuration in mind.
This means that they are not likely to be useful as is on any system, however if you find anything
useful feel free to use it as your own.

NOTE: the bat script is currently missing. This was simply a script that used 
the battery information from the /sys tree to show the remaining power and
the estimated time to load the battery or the remaining time.
