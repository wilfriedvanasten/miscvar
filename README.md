miscvar
=======

Various and miscelaneous little pieces of code and config files I use on my linux systems.

These things are created for personal use and are designed with my standard configuration in mind.
This means that they are not likely to be useful as is on any system.

NOTE: the bat script is currently missing. This was simply a script that used
the battery information from the /sys tree to show the remaining power and
the estimated time to load the battery or the remaining time.

Stow
====

What could be done as such is packaged in a stow way with .stowrc setting
the target to home. Disadvantage is that files are hidden. Remaining
files are explicitly ignored.

The .stowrc here requires at least stow 2.3.0.
